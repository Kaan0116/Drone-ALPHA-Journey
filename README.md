# Drone ALPHA Journey

This project implements an autonomous drone route planning system across T√ºrkiye‚Äôs provinces using stack and queue data structures. The program simulates exploration under realistic constraints such as limited fuel range, priority locations, and weather-restricted provinces.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Project Overview

- The drone starts from Ankara and attempts to visit the maximum number of provinces.
- Stack (LIFO) is used for backtracking when no forward moves are available.
- Queue (FIFO) is used to manage exploration of neighboring provinces.
- Each leg of the journey is limited to 250 km (fuel constraint).
- Some provinces are marked as high-priority, while others are weather-restricted and must be skipped.
- Outputs include the full route, total distance, and summary of priority province visits.

## üìÅ File Structure

```
input/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ distance_data.csv                 # Distance matrix between provinces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ priority_provinces.txt           # List of high-priority provinces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ weather_restricted_provinces.txt# List of inaccessible provinces

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Stack.h / Stack.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Queue.h / Queue.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RoutePlanner.h / RoutePlanner.cpp
```

> `.h` files contain class declarations and function prototypes,  
> `.cpp` files include implementations of corresponding modules.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Compilation and Execution

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp *.h -o DroneALPHA
./DroneALPHA 250 5 distance_data.csv priority_provinces.txt weather_restricted_provinces.txt
```

### Arguments:
- `250`: Maximum allowed distance per move (fuel constraint)
- `5`: Index of starting province (Ankara)
- Input files: distance matrix, priority list, and restricted list

## üì¶ Features

- Custom stack and circular queue structures using static arrays
- CSV-based map loading and dynamic exploration logic
- Skips restricted provinces and prioritizes critical regions
- Tracks visited provinces and prevents revisits
- Structured output: route, visited count, distance, and priority status

## üìå Notes

- All memory management is handled statically (no dynamic allocation).
- Outputs are written to the console with summaries at the end.
- Input files must be in the correct format and order as per usage.
